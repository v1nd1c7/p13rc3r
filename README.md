- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @v1nd1c7
- Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity, system administration, and exploring the dynamic realms of Red Teaming, Blue Teaming, SOC (Security Operation Center), Incident Response, Pentesting, Web and Application Security, Cloud security, and the hardware aspects of cybersecurity.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Bash, Python, and PowerShell scripting to expand my technical capabilities. Additionally, I'm diving into the Bug Bounty space to develop my knowledge of web applications.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cybersecurity projects, hacklabs/hackerspace initiatives, and any opportunities that align with my passion and expertise.
- Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or explore my TryHackMe profile.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Outside the world of cybersecurity, I find solace in reading books on Philosophy, Psychology, and productivity. I enjoy playing Chess and Go, indulging my passion for music by playing the drums and bass guitar. On a sunny day, you might spot me riding my longboard, finding freedom in the wind.
